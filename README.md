## Bank-Customer-Loan-Prediction
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning classification model to predict whether a loan applicant is a bad customer (likely to default) or a good customer (likely to repay the loan). The goal is to assist banks and financial institutions in making informed loan disbursement decisions and reduce financial risk.

🎯 Objective
To predict loan rejection by identifying bad customers based on historical data.

Yes → Loan Rejected (Bad Customer)

No → Loan Approved (Good Customer)

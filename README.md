# Bank-Customer-Loan-Prediction
This project focuses on building a Machine Learning classification model to predict whether a loan applicant is a bad customer (likely to default) or a good customer (likely to repay the loan). The goal is to assist banks and financial institutions in making informed loan disbursement decisions and reduce financial risk.
